## What are differential equations:

In mathematics, a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.

## Objective of the project:

The objective of the project was to implement and compare selected numerical methods and algorithms related to solving ordinary differential equations and other possibilities offered by the MATLAB programming environment in this field of study.

The operational procedures of individual methods and algorithms were exemplified by the following system of differential equations:

$$
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{dy_1}{dt} &= -2y_1 - 2y_2 + x \\
    \frac{dy_2}{dt} &= -2y_1 + 7y_2 + x
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
$$

where $t \in [0, 8]$, and $x(t) = e^{-t} \cdot \sin(t)$. The initial conditions of the differential equation are: $y_1(0) = 0$, $y_2(0) = 0$.

## Report:

In the `Report` folder a file called `Report.pdf`, which contains a further discussion on the topic of solving ordinary differential equations, can be found. As the academic course was conducted in Polish, all the contents of the `Report.pdf` is sadly available only in Polish.
