# About:

This repository contains two projects, which were implemented as a part of Mathematical Modelling academic course.
The course was a part of the curriculum in the winter term of the 2023-2024 academic year at Warsaw University of Technology.

Each project has its own `README.md` file, which contains a brief description of the objective of the project, as well as a `Report.pdf` file, which contains a very detailed desription of the employed methodology.
